## SLR201 - Programmation Avanc√©e et Gestion de Projet (en Java)

Within this repository, we delve into the complexities of the Philosopher's Dining Problem, offering three distinct solutions, each leveraging different programming paradigms:

Multi-Process Approach: This solution employs a multi-process architecture to tackle the problem.
Socket-Based Communication: Here, we utilize socket programming as middleware to facilitate inter-process communication.
Remote Method Invocation (RMI): The third solution employs Java's RMI framework, providing a high-level approach to distributed computing.
Each approach serves as a demonstration of various techniques in advanced Java programming and project management. Navigate to the ./java_advance/philosopher directory for a detailed exploration of each implementation.
