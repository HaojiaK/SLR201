<p>This application would have two parts: a client and a server.

1. The client sends a message to the server;

2. The server receives this message, then responds with "Hello" + the received message + "!";

3. The communication between the two Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) should be done using Java Sockets.

* Create a ServerSocket and make it listen for connections.
* When a client connects, accept the connection and get the Socket.
* Get the InputS
